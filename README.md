# 🌟 Web3 Buy-me-a-coffee

### 📝 Overview

This project is a web application built using React with Next.js, incorporating Web3 technology to create a decentralized platform for gifting coffee to the developer. Inspired by the concept of popular "buy me a coffee" websites, this application allows users to gift coffee to the developer using cryptocurrencies like Matic (MATIC). Users can input their name, a message, and choose the price of the coffee they want to gift. They need to connect their wallets to the application to complete the transaction.

### ✨Features

2.  Dynamic Price Selection: Users can choose from different price options (1, 2, 5, or 10 Matics) for gifting coffee.
3.  Transaction Status Feedback: The application provides feedback to users on the status of their transactions, displaying messages indicating whether the transaction is being executed or has been confirmed.
4.  Coffee Gift List: The application displays a list of coffee gifts received by the developer, including the name of the sender, the message accompanying the gift, and the number of coffees gifted.
